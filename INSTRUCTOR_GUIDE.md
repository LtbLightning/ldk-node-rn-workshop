# Instructor Guide

## Formats to conduct the workshop

As an instructor or coordinator, you can conduct this workshop in different ways depending on the audience and time available. You can live code yourself or let the participants dive in themselves for a more hands-on experience.

### Live coding

One way is to live code while the participants follow along. You can use the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) yourself as a guide.

This approach might be more apt as an introduction for developers with less experience with **React Native** and/or **Bitcoin** who need to be walked through the workshop. It may be better for time-boxed sessions since you can control the pace if you have limited time.

### Hands-on

Another way is to briefly explain the concepts and then let the participants follow the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md), allowing them to implement the code themselves while you are available for questions and to ensure everyone progresses through the workshop.

This approach is more hands-on and might be best suited for developers familiar with **React Native** and Bitcoin who prefer to learn by doing. It may require more time for participants to figure out the code and relevant APIs themselves.

### Mix

A mix of both approaches is also possible. You could start with live coding to give participants a basic understanding of the concepts and workflow, and then switch to a hands-on approach once the participants are comfortable.
